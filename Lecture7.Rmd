# (PART\*) Week 7 {.unnumbered}

# Lecture 7 {#lecture7}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to wrap ggplot2 and dplyr function in a Shiny app.
(If you don't use the tidyverse, you can skip this chapter ðŸ˜„.) The techniques for wrapping ggplot2 and dplyr functions in a functions and package, are a a little different and covered in other resources like [*Using ggplot2 in packages*](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html) or [*Programming with dplyr*](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html).


## Motivation {#tidy-motivation}

Imagine I want to create an app that allows you to filter a numeric variable to select rows that are greater than a threshold.
You might write something like this:

Let's begin with this call to `filter()` which uses a data-variable (`carat`) and an env-variable (`min`):

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + 
  geom_point()
```
